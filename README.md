# Mastering Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

This project is a long-term personal journey to master data structures and algorithms through consistent practice, implementation, and experimentation. It is inspired by different structured learning programs and research that blend theory with examples and deep explanations.

The goal is to build, visualize, and understand core data structures and algorithms from scratch, while improving Java coding fluency, problem-solving ability, and interview readiness for high-impact software engineering roles.

## 🧠 Learning Approach

This is a learning-by-building initiative. Every data structure or algorithm is implemented from first principles — no shortcuts or pre-built library methods unless for validation or benchmarking.
Topics may include:
  - Detailed code implementation
  - Unit tests for verification
  - Complexity analysis
  - Visual aids or notes in /docs

<br>

## Tech Stack
  - Language: Java 21
  - Build Tool: Gradle
  - Testing: JUnit 5
  - Documentation: Markdown + UML/PlantUML diagrams

<br>

## 🚀 Long-Term Vision
This repository will evolve into a comprehensive DSA reference for Java developers — a personal knowledge base combining code, diagrams, insights, and test-driven examples that can serve both as a learning record and a technical portfolio.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Clone the project
```Bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/elshad-karimov-master-dsa-java.git
cd elshad-karimov-master-dsa-java
```

### Build and run
```Bash
./gradlew build
```

### Run tests
```Bash
./gradlew test
```

### Add a new module
In settings.gradle:
```Groovy
include("modules:arrays")
```
Then create `modules/arrays/build.gradle` and start coding your first data structure.
